# Introduction to Amazon Web Services
AWS offers a wide range of services such as

- compute
- storage
- network security tools

with complex solutions like

- blockchain
- machine learning
- artificial intelligence

and specialized tool sets like

- robot development platforms
- video production management systems
- orbital satellites

### Client-server Model
***Clients*** can be web browsers or desktop applications that people interact with to make requests to computer servers. <\br>
***Servers*** can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), which is a type of virtual server. <\br>

### Pay-for-what-you-need
At AWS, there's no need to pre-pay for anything or worry about capacity constraints. <\br>
This is the first ***key value*** of running businesses on AWS. <\br>

## Cloud Computing
On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. <\br>

- ***On-demand Delivery*** enables businesses to access resources when you need them, without the need to tell AWS in advance how much is needed. <\br>
They can be returned when not needed anymore, just as quickly.

- ***IT Resources*** are IT elements that are common across a number of businesses, are not differentiators. <\br>
Using a MYSQL database for example, the ability to install the MYSQL engine or the way backups are kept don't make companies better than competitors. <\br>
On the other hand, the data inside the database, the ways tables are built and structures are managed, are what separates companies from the competition. <\br>
At AWS, this is called the ***undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT***. <\br>
By helping with tasks that are common, repetitive and time-consuming, AWS enables companies to focus on what makes them unique.

- ***Over The Internet*** refers to the ability to access resources programmatically or using a secure webpage console.

- ***Pay-as-you-go Pricing*** means no additional contracts or sales calls are needed, as AWS emphasizes that not all resources are needed 24 hours a day at the same levels as during peak hours. <\br>
Why pay for developer environments on weekends if the developers aren't working on the weekends?

### Deployment Models
Factors to consider when selecting a cloud strategy include required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools and legacy IT infrastructure requirements. <\br>
- ***Cloud-based***
    - Run applications fully in the cloud
    - Migrate existing applications to the cloud
    - Design and build new applications in the cloud
    - Build with low-level infrastructure that requires management or higher-level services that reduce management, architecting and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure
- ***On-premises***
- ***Hybrid***
