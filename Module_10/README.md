# The Cloud Journey
Each individual AWS service is used as building blocks for solutions, there are endless architectures that can be created to solve problems. </br>
But the question is how does one know if the architecture is good?. </br>

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework
This is where the ***AWS Well-Architected Framework*** comes in, it helps companies understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. </br>
It provides a way to consistently measure companies' architectures against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement. </br>
The framework is based on six pillars

- ***Operational excellence***
    - Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
    - Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include
        - Performing operations as code
        - Annotating documentation
        - Anticipating failure
        - Frequently making small and reversible changes
- ***Security***
    - Ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
    - Best practices to apply when considering the security of the architecture
        - Automating security best practices when possible
        - Applying security at all layers
        - Protecting data in transit and at rest
- ***Reliability***
    - Ability of a system to do the following
        - Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
        - Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
        - Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
    - Methods to increase reliability
        - Testing recovery procedures
        - Scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
        - Automatically recovering from failure
- ***Performance efficiency***
    - Ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
    - Ways to evaluate performance efficiency
        - Experimenting more often
        - Using serverless architectures
        - Designing systems to be able to go global in minutes
- ***Cost optimization***
    - Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
    - Methods to improve cost optimization
        - Adopting a consumption model
        - Analyzing and attributing expenditure
        - Using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership
- ***Sustainability***
    - Ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required
    - Ways to facilitate good design for sustainability
        - Understanding the company's impact
        - Establishing sustainability goals
        - Maximizing utilization
        - Anticipating and adopting new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
        - Using managed services
        - Reducing the downstream impact of the cloud workloads

## Benefits of the AWS Cloud
Operating in the AWS Cloud offers many benefits over computing in on-premises or hybrid environments. </br>
There are six advantages of cloud computing

- ***Trade upfront expense for variable expense***
    - Instead of investing heavily in data centers and physical servers before knowing how they're going to be used, companies can pay only when the computing resources are consumed
- ***Benefit from massive economies of scale***
    - Companies can achieve a lower variable cost than they can get on their own, thanks to the aggregation of usage from hundreds of thousands of customers
- ***Stop guessing capacity***
    - Companies don't need to predict how much infrastructure capacity they will need before deploying an application, instead of paying for resources that are unused or dealing with limited capacity, they can access only the capacity that's needed and scale in or out in response to demand
- ***Increase speed and agility***
    - The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier to develop and deploy applications, it also provides development teams with more time to experiment and innovate
- ***Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers***
    - Ability to focus less on tasks like managing infrastructure and servers and more on applications and customers
- ***Go global in minutes***
    - The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables companies to quickly deploy applications to customers around the world while providing them with low latency
