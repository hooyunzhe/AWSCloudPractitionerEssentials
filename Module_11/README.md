## Exam Strategies
Here are three strategies to help increase the probability of passing the exam

- ***Read the full question***
    - Make sure that each question is read in full
    - Key words or phrases in the question, if left unread, could result in selecting an incorrect response option
- ***Predict the answer before reviewing the response options***
    - Predict the correct answer before looking at any of the response options
    - Helps to draw directly from knowledge and skills without distraction from incorrect response options
    - Make sure to still review all other response options
- ***Eliminate incorrect response options***
    - Before selecting the response, eliminate any options that seem incorrect
    - Helps to focus on the correct option (or options, for multiple-response questions) and ensure that all the requirements of the question have been fulfilled
